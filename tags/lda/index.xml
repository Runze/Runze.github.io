      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve become very interested in text mining and topic modeling, and have played around with some popular algorithms like LDA. However, so far my projects have all been centered around what I can learn from a giant chunk of texts and usually stopped after I extracted some revealing and, if I&amp;rsquo;m lucky, thought-provoking topics from them. In other words, what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing so far is all inference but no predictions.</description>
