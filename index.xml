      <description>Hi,
This is my dog and, if you look carefully, that is me behind:
I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist, an avid language-learner, and a self-proclaimed art-lover. And that&amp;rsquo;s really all that is interesting about me.
Bye.</description>

      <description>This weekend I decided to learn more about twitter and its handy API. My subject of the analysis is Artsy, a fine-art website that provides a pandora-like service. The subjects I was curious to find out are where their followers are from, what their twitter activities are like, what other interests they have, and, specifically, what kind of stereotypes clusters they fall into because, you know, it’s important and I didn’t have anything better to do.</description>
