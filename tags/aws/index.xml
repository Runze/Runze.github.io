      <description>Background Recently, I came across this blog post written by Vicki Boykis in which she documented her process of building a Twitter bot that tweets Soviet artworks in scheduled intervals. Inspired by the idea (and motivated by boredom), I decided to build a Twitter bot myself that tells questionably coherent stories through a series of tweets. I loved this idea because first of all, I love literature, especially the classics.</description>
