      <description>The R code used to create this app has been uploaded to [github](https://github.com/Runze/pitchfork). After the numerous times of finding out about a concert too late and ending up either paying a premium or not being able to go, I finally decided to do something about it, and this is what I came up with.

This R Shiny app I made pulls data from pitchfork automatically every time it&amp;rsquo;s open and shows the upcoming shows per city and per artist (indie artist, to be precise).</description>
