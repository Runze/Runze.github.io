      <description>If you are not from China or living there, you are probably not familiar with the term 八零后, or post-80s, but if you are, like me, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that this is probably one of the most widely used and abused terms in modern China. Quite literally, it refers to Chinese people who were born in the 1980s (me included) and the reason it gained so much attention and exposure as compared to, say, 九零后 (post-90s) or 零零后 (post-00s), I think, stems from the fact that our generation has simply seen and been through way too many things that have never been seen or experienced by prior generations and are simply taken as norms for later ones.</description>
